Add HOLD hotkeys to OBS
This is a simple Autohotkey script (requires Autohotkey https://www.autohotkey.com/ ) that uses AHK's "keyWait" function.
This detects when you start holding a key and when you stop holding a key, and sends a hotkey each time.
This allows you to effectively add "hold hotkey" optionality to OBS Studio (or any application accepting hotkeys) when it's not present.

Alternatively, if using filters instead of source toggling, OBS-Filter-Hotkeys actually has hold functionality already: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-filter-hotkeys.1125/
